description: Open311 is meant to facilitate an international effort to build open
  interoperable systems that allow citizens to more directly interact with their cities.
  Many 311 systems provide a broad range of information and services, but currently
  the primary focus here is coordinating a standardized, open-access, read/write model
  for citizens to report non-emergency issues. For a broad overview, see the Learn
  More page, for an in-depth look see the post that describes Open311 as a specification
  for an open platform, and for general information about 311, see the Wikipedia page
  on 311.
